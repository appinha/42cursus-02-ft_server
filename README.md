## Study Summary

### Docker

[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) is a solution for the management of lightweight process containers.

An **image** is an object that you can download and reuse to instantiate new containers. Ready-made images are provided in Docker's official repositories (their "official images"), the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Docker can **build images** automatically by reading the instructions from a [**Dockerfile**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) - a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. Using `docker build` users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

The build is run by the Docker daemon, not by the CLI. **Docker daemon** is a server which interacts with the operating system and performs all kinds of services.

An `ENTRYPOINT` identifies which executable should be run when a container is started from your image.

**Docker CLI commands:**

* `docker images` - List all docker images.
* `docker rmi [image_name]` - Remove image.
* `docker build -t [image_name] .` - Build an image from a Dockerfile (in current location).
* `docker run --name [container_name] image` - Start a container from an image, with a custom name.
* `docker run --name [container_name] -it -p 80:80 -p 443:443 [name]` - `-i` interactive, `-p` ports.
* `docker start|stop [container_name]` - Start or stop an existing container.
* `docker ps` - List **currently running** docker containers.
* `docker ps -a` - List **all** docker containers (running and stopped).
* `docker exec -it [container_name] sh` - Open a shell inside of an already running container.
* `docker rm [container_name]` - Remove a stopped container.

### NGINX

[**NGINX**](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/?_ga=2.203137169.148315847.1594301020-870972343.1594301020) (read as "engine-x"	) is a lightweight, high-performance web server designed for high-traffic use cases.

### SSL Protocol

[**OpenSSL**](https://www.openssl.org/) is a software library for applications that secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping or need to identify the party at the other end.

### MySQL & MariaDB

[**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system.

[**MariaDB**](https://mariadb.org/) is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.

### phpMyAdmin

[**phpMyAdmin**](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) is a free and open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB.

### Wordpress

[**WordPress**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) (WP, [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/)) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.
